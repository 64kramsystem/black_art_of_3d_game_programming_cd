         * *     INSTALLING AND SETTING UP THE PROGRAM     * *
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLING THE PROGRAM (MANUALLY)
---------------------------------

NOTE: The following instructions for installing the software should
only be used if you've been unable to install the program as described
in the accompanying book.

FLOPPY DISK SETUP

Review the list of files for the NorthCAD-3D program.  They are listed
at the beginning of this document.  Copy all of the listed files from
the disk that came with the book to a diskette with 720K or greater
storage capacity.  Then proceed to the section: PROGRAM CONFIGURATION

HARD DISK SETUP

Be sure you are in the root directory of your hard disk.

     C> CD\

Next, create a sub directory for the NorthCAD-3D program files:

     C> MD NCVR

Go to this new directory.

     C> CD NCVR

Review the list of files for the NorthCAD-3D program.  They are listed
at the beginning of this document. Copy all of the listed files with
the extensions EXE, CFG, and DOC from the disk that came with the book
to the NCVR directory.

Next, create a two subdirectories from the NCVR directory:

     C> MD DRAWINGS

     C> MD LIBRARY

Go to the drawings directory.

     C> CD DRAWINGS

Now copy all of the listed files that are described as being a "Sample
Drawing File" to this directory.  Next, copy the file: DEFAULTS.NC3 to
this directory as well.

Next, go to the library directory.

     C> CD C:\NCVR\LIBRARY

Then copy all of the listed files that are described as being a
"Library File" to this directory.  And finally, copy the file:
DEFAULTS.NC3 to this directory too.

Return to the NCVR directory, and proceed to the next section, Program
Configuration.

NOTES: RUNNING NORTHCAD-3D UNDER WINDOWS 3.1
--------------------------------------------

NorthCAD-3D is still a DOS program, however, it can be run under
Windows as a DOS application.  An Icon file: NORTHCAD.ICO has been
included if you care to set up a program group for NorthCAD-3D.

A couple of things to remember: Be sure you load your mouse driver from
DOS prior to starting Windows.  And, set the "start-up" directory for
the program group (Properties-Options in Windows) to the directory
where the NorthCAD-3D program files are located.  Other than that,
there aren't any special requirements for running NorthCAD-3D under
Windows.



PROGRAM CONFIGURATION
---------------------

Start the NorthCAD-3D program by typing NCVR at the DOS prompt.

After the main screen appears, move the mouse cursor over the PROGRAM
CONFIGURATION Menu Banner, and click the Left Mouse Button.

Next, select the RESOLUTION/COLOR Banner.  Then select the color and
resolution mode you wish to use when designing 3-D drawings.  Then
select SAVE.

You'll also need to configure the file directories NorthCAD-3D will use
to load and retrieve your drawing and library files, as well as where
to save the Rend386 Virtual Reality files.  Select the PROGRAM
CONFIGURATION Banner again, and this time select the FILE DIRECTORY
Banner.

Make the necessary CHANGEs to the drive and path specifications.  For
example, if you've installed the program onto a Floppy Disk, enter the
appropriate drive letter and colon punctuation mark.  For example:  B:

If you've installed the program onto your Hard Disk, then enter the
appropriate drive letter, colon, backslash, and path.  For example
C:\NCVR\DRAWINGS

Then select SAVE.

The program is now configured and ready for operation.

            * * *     HOW TO OPERATE THE PROGRAM     * * *
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

3-D MODELING EDITOR
------------------

Always start the NorthCAD-3D program from the Main Program Module:
NCVR.EXE

Then, from the opening screen in the Main Program Module, select the 3-
D MODELING EDITOR Menu Banner.  You can either pick a file from the
directory list for editing or viewing, or you can select NEW to begin a
new drawing.

If you select NEW, you'll be prompted to enter a filename.  Enter a
filename 1-8 characters in length. (It's unnecessary to add the NC3
extension).


MOUSE OPERATION
---------------

LEFT AND RIGHT MOUSE BUTTONS: The LEFT MOUSE BUTTON operates similar to
the ENTER Key on the keyboard.  When you wish to select a menu item,
enter a data point, or when prompted to press Enter, you can click your
Left Mouse Button.  The RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON is similar to using the
ESCAPE key.  To exit a drawing command or to cancel an input prompt,
simply click your Right Mouse Button.

THE MOUSE AND ORTHOGRAPHIC VIEWPOINTS

When using any of the drawing commands, the graphics cursor is moved by
sliding your mouse in any direction.  Because the exact direction the
cursor moves on screen is influenced by your current 3-D viewpoint, you
might find drawing from Orthographic Viewpoints more convenient, and
easier to control while you're learning the software.  When drawing
from viewpoints other than Orthographic, users often find larger cursor
sizes helpful (see the SETTINGS command).

DRAWING SNAP

The program uses Drawing Snap which always moves the graphics cursor by
the distance of the Drawing Unit increment, and enables you to remain
in scale with each mouse movement.  The drawing increment can be
adjusted with the F9 Key from the Draw Menu of the modeling editor, or
while using any of the drawing commands.


THE GRAPHICS SCREEN
-------------------

The graphics screen consists of the graphics viewport and the menu
panel.  The menu panel consists of a column of buttons and icons down
the far right-hand side of the graphics screen.  They're grouped into
three (3) main sections: the Command Menu, the Pan and Zoom Icons, and
the Settings Area.

COMMAND MENU

The name of the menu being displayed is located in the top button on
the menu panel.  (It's non-functional, so don't worry if nothing
happens when you click on it).

Below the name of the menu, are Twelve (12) Menu Buttons.  Here, the
program displays any active commands that you may select.  To select
any of the commands, point to the button with the mouse cursor and
click the Left Mouse Button.  The command will either perform the
specified design task, prompt you for a keyboard entry, or display a
sub menu.

PAN AND ZOOM ICONS

Located just below the last menu button are the Pan and Zoom Icons.
These icon buttons control the viewing size and target location of the
drawing in the viewport.  Buttons are selected by pointing to them with
the mouse cursor, and clicking the Left Mouse Button.

The icon layout and operation is as follows:

                               PAN ICONS
                                   
               Up & Left          Up          Up & Right
               Left         Window Pan/Zoom        Right
               Down & Left       Down       Down & Right
                                   
                                   
                              ZOOM ICONS
                                   
                 Zoom Out                     Zoom In

The Pan icons are used to move your view in the direction of the icon
arrows.  The increment of movement is controlled dynamically by the
program and will Pan your view by One-Third (1/3) the viewport
distance.  If you attempt to Pan farther than the limits of 3-D space,
the program will sound a short Beep and will not continue to pan
farther than is possible.

The center Pan icon, known as the Pan and Zoom Window command, enables
you to select your own portion of the drawing to view.  Using your
mouse, pick a point on the screen for one of the corners, then extend a
rubber-banding rectangle to the desired size.  You can also press the
"R" Key while the Pan and Zoom Window command is active in order to
reset both Pan and Zoom back to Normal.  You can zoom into an area of
the drawing as small as 400 drawing units across.

The Zoom In and Out Icons are used to increase or decrease the viewing
size of the drawing.  They don't scale your drawing, they magnify the
view.  Each pick of the Zoom icons adjusts the view by 800 drawing
units (400 units on each side).  Viewing sizes range from +-3300 units
on each axis, down to +-400 units.  If you attempt to Zoom greater than
is allowed, the program will sound a short Beep.

SETTINGS AREA

The last panel of the menu provides for the display of various command
and operation settings.  When appropriate, the program displays the
current settings in effect for the command or menu you're using.


KEYBOARD REFERENCE
------------------

The following function key commands are available in the 3-D Modeling
Editor.

F1   ON-LINE KEYBOARD REFERENCE.  The graphics viewport is cleared, and
     a listing of keyboard commands is displayed.  The reference
     includes both function keys and letter keys.  To exit, press the
     Escape Key, or click the right mouse button.

F2   PREVIOUS VIEWPOINT AND DRAWING PLANE.  Redraws your drawing using
     the last VIEWPOINT command values, and sets the Drawing Plane to
     the one last used from that viewpoint.  This function key command
     can be used to return to your previous 3-D viewpoint after having
     used any of the Orthographic View keys.  This gives you the
     ability to jump from view to view, then back to your 3-D view
     again, without having to use the Viewpoint command or manually
     reset your drawing plane.

F3   LEFT ORTHOGRAPHIC VIEW AND DRAWING PLANE.  Redraws your drawing
     using the left Orthographic viewpoint.  Additionally, the Left-
     Right Drawing Plane is automatically selected, since it's the most
     likely plane to be used when drawing from this viewpoint.

F4   RIGHT ORTHOGRAPHIC VIEW AND DRAWING PLANE.  Redraws your drawing
     using the right Orthographic viewpoint.  Additionally, the Left-
     Right Drawing Plane is automatically selected, since it's the most
     likely plane to be used when drawing from this viewpoint.

F5   TOP ORTHOGRAPHIC VIEW AND DRAWING PLANE.  Redraws your drawing
     using the top Orthographic viewpoint.  Additionally, the Top-
     Bottom Drawing Plane is automatically selected, since it's the
     most likely plane to be used when drawing from this viewpoint.

F6   FRONT ORTHOGRAPHIC VIEW AND DRAWING PLANE.  Redraws your drawing
     using the front Orthographic viewpoint.  Additionally, the Front-
     Back Drawing Plane is automatically selected, since it's the most
     likely plane to be used when drawing from this viewpoint.

F7   PERSPECTIVE ON/OFF.  Toggles Perspective Mode On and Off.  When
     Perspective Mode is On, the drawing is displayed using 3-Point
     Perspective.  Horizontal lines, as well as vertical lines, are
     automatically adjusted to slope to unseen vanishing points.

F8   AXES GRID ON/OFF.  Toggles the display of an Axes Grid On and Off.
     When the Axes Grid is On, a line is drawn along each Axes (X, Y,
     and Z), and is useful when aligning your drawing to the center of
     the view rotation point located at (0,0,0).

F9   DRAWING UNITS & VIEWPOINT DEGREE INCREMENTS. While on the Draw
     Menu, or during any of the drawing commands, pressing the F9 Key
     enables you to specify a new drawing unit increment.  The current
     Drawing Unit is displayed below the Draw Menu in the Settings
     Area.  Values can range from 1 to 500.  While using the VIEWPOINT
     command, the F9 Key enables you to specify a new degree increment.
     The current degree increment will be displayed in the Settings
     Area.  Values can range from 1 to 45.

F10  REDRAW.  Clears the viewport and redraws your drawing.  This
     command can be used to clean up lines that may have become
     partially erased during a Move or Scale command operation.

F11  ABSOLUTE/RELATIVE COORDINATES.  Toggles the display of either
     Absolute or Relative coordinates.  Absolute coordinates display
     the true X,Y,Z position of the graphics cursor in 3-D space.
     Relative coordinates display the distance from the last point
     entered.  Relative coordinates can assist you in tracking
     distances, whereas Absolute coordinates can be used to find
     specific coordinate locations.  On the Draw Menu, the X,Y,Z
     coordinates are displayed in the Settings Area.  The "A" prefix
     signifies Absolute, and an "R" prefix signifies Relative.

F12  SAVE DRAWING FILE. Saves the current drawing to disk.  This key
     simply provides a fast alternative from having to go to the Files
     Menu to save your file.  This key can be used from any menu, but
     note that confirmation messages are not displayed.

P    CHANGE DRAWING PLANE.  While on the Draw Menu, or during any of
     the drawing commands, this key allows you to cycle the selection
     of the Drawing Plane.  The three Drawing Planes are: LEFT-RIGHT,
     FRONT-BACK, and TOP-BOTTOM.  This key can also be used to manually
     override the Drawing Plane selections set by the Orthographic
     Keys, or when drawing from a 3-D viewpoint set by the VIEWPOINT
     command.  On the Draw Menu, the current Drawing Plane is displayed
     in the Settings Area.

S    SNAP TO NEAREST POINT.  While on the Draw Menu, or during any of
     the drawing commands, the "S" Key automatically repositions the
     graphics cursor to the nearest endpoint of a line segment, or
     surface vertex.  (The Snap Zone range can be set from the Settings
     Menu).  The Snap command also enables you to quickly change the
     coordinates of your current drawing plane, since the drawing plane
     coordinates are also shifted to those of the new snap point.  And
     Snap is an excellent method for getting back "in scale" with a
     drawing you have just moved or scaled.




   -----------------------------------------------------------------
        * * * *     3-D DESIGN: THE BASIC CONCEPTS     * * * *
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

3-D SPACE: THE DRAWING ENVIRONMENT

In order to create true three-dimensional images it's necessary to have
the ability to specify locations in space for each element you're
constructing.  To identify these locations, a coordinate system is used
to indicate their position.

In two-dimensional drawings, positions are indicated by distances along
the width and length of the design.  The width is known as the X-axis
and the length is known as the Y-axis.

As you move into the world of three-dimensional design, one more
coordinate axis is needed to indicate the designs' height.  Thus, the
coordinate axis for height is the Z-axis.

Consequently, a coordinate format of X,Y,Z will specify the exact
position in width, length, and height.

MOVEMENT ON THE DRAWING PLANES

In NorthCAD-3D, and most other CAD programs, specifying the values for
each of these positions is accomplished by moving a graphics cursor
displayed on your computer screen to the desired location.  The
movement of the graphics cursor is controlled by moving your mouse, or
pressing the cursor keys.

However, the mouse and cursor keys only give you two-dimensional
movement capabilities, so the graphics cursor can not travel in more
than two directions at a time.  You must therefore selectively choose
which two directions you want to be able to move.  Each direction
correlates with a particular axis, so you essentially have three pairs
of axis on which you can choose to travel.  The axis pair combinations
are the X-Y Axes, Y-Z Axes, X-Z Axes.  Each one of the 3 combinations
is referred to as a Drawing Plane.

To make it easier to visualize which drawing plane the cursor will
travel on, NorthCAD-3D uses names for each of these planes that
correspond to the sides of your image.  They are the LEFT-RIGHT PLANE,
FRONT-BACK PLANE, and the TOP-BOTTOM PLANE.

DRAWING PLANE SELECTION

As you create a design using any of the drawing commands, you can
change drawing planes as needed to position the graphics cursor.  An
easy method of determining which drawing plane to select, is to
visualize the side of your image the cursor must travel on in order to
get to your desired location.  Since the drawing planes are named after
the sides of an image, simply select the plane with the corresponding
side.

To make it even easier, NorthCAD-3D also has a feature for automatic
drawing plane selection.  As noted above, drawing planes are similar to
the corresponding sides of a drawing.  The program has therefore linked
the Orthographic Viewpoint Keys (F3-F6) to the selection of a drawing
plane.  For example, if you press the F3 Key you'll get a Left View of
your drawing, and the drawing plane will automatically be changed to
Left-Right.

The program also enables users to manually control drawing plane
selection without changing their viewpoints.  This allows the creation
of drawings from viewpoints anywhere around your drawing.  While on the
Draw Menu, or while using any of the drawing commands, the "P" Key can
be used to cycle the drawing plane selection. (Note however, that some
drawing commands can only be used on a single plane at a time, and will
lock the plane after you have entered the first coordinate of the
command).

Included with the program are three tutorial sample drawing files. Each
file illustrates one of the three drawing planes:

     The FBPLANE.NC3 file shows the Front-Back Drawing plane.
     The LRPLANE.NC3 file shows the Left-Right Drawing plane.
     The TBPLANE.NC3 file shows the Top-Bottom Drawing plane.

(For simplicity, only the Left, Right, Up, and Down movements have been
illustrated).

When viewing the three tutorial illustration files, use the VIEWPOINT
command to pick new viewpoints.  Note the direction of the arrows - the
arrows indicate the path the graphics cursor will take when either
Left, Right, Up, or Down, mouse movement occurs when using that
particular drawing plane.

Using the concepts described above, and trying out a drawing of your
own, you'll quickly discover how the correlation between the drawing
planes and your viewpoint give you the freedom to accurately create
images from any location in 3-D space. More specific descriptions for
each of the three drawing planes can be found below.


DRAWING PLANES
--------------

FRONT-BACK sets the movement of the graphics cursor to move in relation
to the Front or Back side of the drawing, and in relation to your
viewpoint.  Left and Right mouse movement (or cursor keys) will move
the graphics cursor along the Width of your drawing (the X-axis), while
Forward or Backward mouse movement moves the graphics cursor along the
Height of the drawing (the Z-axis).  The current Y coordinate value
remains locked in place.

LEFT-RIGHT sets the movement of the graphics cursor to move in relation
to the Left or Right side of the drawing, and in relation to your
viewpoint.  Left and Right mouse movement will move the graphics cursor
along the Length of your drawing (the Y-axis), while Forward or
Backward mouse movement moves the graphics cursor along the Height of
the drawing (the Z-axis).  The current X coordinate value remains
locked in place.

TOP-BOTTOM sets the movement of the graphics cursor to move in relation
to the Top or Bottom side of the drawing, and in relation to your
viewpoint.  Left and Right mouse movement will move the graphics cursor
along the Width of your drawing (the X-axis), while Forward or Backward
mouse movement moves the graphics cursor along the Length of the
drawing (the Y-axis).  The current Z coordinate value remains locked in
place.


NOTES: Appropriate Drawing Planes can be automatically selected by
using the Orthographic Viewpoint Keys (F3-F6).

The "P" Key is used to set the Drawing Plane manually, or to override
an automatic selection.

The current Drawing Plane is displayed below the Draw Menu in the
Settings Area.


DRAWING HIERARCHY
-----------------

Elements within a drawing file all belong to a particular drawing
hierarchy which determines their level of creation, editing, and
manipulation control. Knowing the levels that you can control will help
you get the most versatility out of the software. The hierarchy of
elements in a NorthCAD-3D drawing are listed below from the lowest
level to the highest level.


                     LINE SEGMENTS  AND  SURFACES
                                   .
                                   .
                                   .
                               ENTITIES
                                   .
                                   .
                                   .
                                OBJECTS
                                   .
                                   .
                                   .
                           GROUPS OF OBJECTS
                                   .
                                   .
                                   .
                               THE WORLD


LINE SEGMENTS AND SURFACES are the smallest elements in a drawing file.
A line segment can be either a line that you've drawn with the LINES
command, or it can also be part of another drawing entity such as an
Arc - which is composed of a series of short line segments.
Additionally, a surface can be either a surface that you've drawn with
the SURFACE command, or it can be part of an object you've Extruded or
Revolved - which creates surfaces from drawing entities.

Line Segment and Surface control primarily consists of the ability to
erase them from the drawing or change their color. But as simple as
this sounds, it actually gives you tremendous versatility in creating
complex and interesting objects.

For example, assume you want to create a yellow sphere with a green
stripe around it, and you also want a few holes in the sphere so
objects placed inside the sphere can also be seen. To create this
object, you would simply draw a yellow Arc, change the color of one of
the line segments that make up the arc to the color green, then use the
Revolve command to turn the Arc into a sphere, and finally erase a few
of the surfaces from the sphere with the Erase Surface command and the
object is finished. In this example, having the capability to edit a
line segment on the Arc, allows you to skip having to edit every
surface around the sphere in order to change its color, and being able
to actually edit down to the surface level of the sphere enables you to
create an object that might otherwise have been to time consuming to
design.


ENTITIES are drawing elements that have been created with any of the
Drawing commands. For instance, a Polygon is a drawing entity. An
individual line drawn with the LINE command, or a single surface drawn
with the SURFACE command can also be considered to be an entity, even
though their hierarchy level is also lower.

Entities are used to form the objects that you'll later EXTRUDE or
REVOLVE into 3-D objects.  For example, a Polygon can be extruded to
form a tube, or it can be revolved to form a torus (donut).
Additionally, two or more entities can be used together to form the
shape for an extrusion, such as connecting a line to each end of an arc
in order to create a beveled edge. And since NorthCAD-3D functions down
to the line segment level, you can also "snap" to any of the line
segments in an entity in order to attach another entity at that point.


OBJECTS are collections of drawing entities that you've designated to
be part of a drawing item, for example a chair or a lamp. Objects can
also be created by combining other objects together to form a new
object, but they are always a collection of drawing entities.

When you're creating objects with any of the drawing commands, every
entity is being assigned to a specific object. This object is selected,
and named, by you with the WORK OBJECT command on the Draw Menu. Every
entity you draw thereafter is assigned to this current object. When you
wish to work on a new object, or continue with a previous one, you'll
simply select it again with the WORK OBJECT command.

The name of the current object is displayed above the Draw Menu, so you
don't need to worry about remembering which object you're working on.
However, whenever you enter the Draw Menu, it's always a good idea to
check the name of the current object, just to be sure it's the one you
want to be working on. In case you forget though, or need to make
changes, there are commands located on the Object Menu that allow you
to redesignate entities from one object to another.


GROUPS OF OBJECTS are collections of objects that you've designated as
being a single controllable item.  For instance, an airplane can be
composed of numerous objects, but all the objects can be linked to form
a Group so you can control them as one item.  You can also make changes
to any of the objects within the group, without affecting the other
objects.

For example, the engine on the plane could be made up of several
different objects, including a propeller. While the propeller and all
the engine parts, as well as all the other objects that make up the
plane, belong to a single group, you can still rotate the propeller to
a new angle without affecting the other parts of the plane. Likewise,
with group control you have the power to rotate the entire plane in one
operation, and still maintain the original alignment of all the
objects.


THE WORLD consists of everything in the drawing - Groups, Objects,
Entities, Line Segments and Surfaces. The World is the highest level in
the drawing hierarchy, and changes at this level affect everything in
the drawing. For example, changing the background color or selecting a
new viewpoint are operations that work at the world level.
Additionally, there are options on the Move and Scale menus that can
also be used at the world level.


THE QUICK START GUIDELINES FOR CREATING DRAWINGS
------------------------------------------------

In case you're in a hurry to get started, and don't plan on reading
much of the manual, the following guidelines might help you stay out of
trouble.

Whenever you enter the Draw Menu, learn to get into the habit of
checking which object is being worked on.  The name of the current Work
Object is displayed above the Draw Menu on the right hand side of the
screen.  It's also printed using the current drawing color.

If you haven't selected a Work Object, the program displays "No Name"
instead.  Before you begin drawing, pick the WORK OBJECT command, and
select the name of the object you want all the subsequent drawing
entities assigned to.  If it's a new drawing, the [] symbols refer to
empty and available objects.  Select the first available [] and you'll
be prompted to enter a name for the object.  When the Draw Menu
reappears, notice that the name of your current Work Object is now
displayed above the menu.

Whenever you wish to draw in a different color, select the PEN COLOR
command.

The size of the Graphics cursor, not to be confused with the mouse
cursor, can be adjusted on the SETTINGS menu.  The sizes range from a
small target cursor to a full screen cross hair cursor.

The distance the graphics cursor travels each time the mouse is moved,
or a cursor key is pressed can be adjusted on the Draw Menu, or while
any of the drawing commands are active, by simply pressing the F9 KEY.

Most users create their 3-D objects using either the Extrude or Revolve
commands.  The drawing commands are used to draw the object's contours,
then they're extruded or revolved.

However, Do Not Extrude or Revolve Surfaces.  The entity is already a
surface, and extruding a surface only results in creating a new single
surface.

The Revolve command rotates around the Height axis (Z-axis) at the Zero
(0) coordinate.  If you desire a symmetrical cylindrical object.  You
should therefore, draw your contour object using a Y-Coordinate of Zero
(0).  Any other Y-Coordinate results in some rather interesting shapes
- which is also why we let you use other coordinates.

The Revolve and Extrude commands use confirmation menus after each
operation, so you can either accept or reject the new extrusion.  This
allows you to experiment quite easily with other settings.




   -----------------------------------------------------------------
        * * * * *     COMMAND AND MENU REFERENCE     * * * * *
   -----------------------------------------------------------------


COPY MENU

    Commands on this menu enable you to copy either an individual
    OBJECT or a GROUP of objects. The copy will become a new object in
    the drawing, so you'll also be prompted to enter a name for the new
    object.

    SAME creates a copy in the same position as the original. You won't
    be able to tell it's there until you move it, and when you do, the
    underlying object will become temporarily erased when you do move
    it. (Use the F10 Key to redraw it).
    
    The LEFT, RIGHT, FORWARD, BACKWARD, UP and DOWN commands will
    create the copy in the respective direction.  The distance from the
    original is controlled by the OFFSET.
               

DRAW MENU

    Commands on this menu enable you to create specific drawing
    entities such as SURFACES, LINES, POLYGONS, and ARCS. Except for
    SURFACES, any object created using these commands can be either
    Extruded or Revolved into 3-D objects made of surfaces.  Each
    drawing command automatically repeats after the entity has been
    created.  To exit, press Escape, or click the right mouse button.

    WORK OBJECT sets the current object designation. All entities drawn
    are designated as belonging to the current object.  The Current
    Work Object is displayed above the Draw Menu.  To specify a current
    work object, select the name from the displayed list.  If you wish
    to start on a new object, select the [] symbols.  These symbols
    represent new and available objects.  You'll then be prompted to
    enter a name for your new object.
               
    PEN COLOR allows you to select the current drawing color. In case
    you forget which color you're using, the name of the current Work
    Object is always printed in the current drawing color.
               
    Below the Draw Menu, the Settings Area displays the current X,Y,Z
    Coordinate location of the graphics cursor.  An "a" prefix
    signifies that the coordinates are being displayed in Absolute
    values - the true coordinate location in 3D space.  An "r" prefix
    signifies the coordinates are being displayed in Relative values -
    the distance from the last point entered.  The F11 Key, or the "C"
    Key toggles the coordinate type.
               
    MEM% displays the percentage of drawing memory currently being
    used.  This display will be updated after each use of a drawing
    command.  With Version 9.5VR, you can create files as large as 1000
    surfaces.
               
    UNIT displays the current drawing unit increment.  The F9 Key can
    be used to specify a new increment while either on the Draw Menu,
    or during the use of any of the drawing commands.
               
    DRAWING PLANE indicates on which of the three drawing planes the
    cursor is traveling on.  The "P" Key can be used to toggle the
    selection, and can be pressed while on the Draw Menu, or during any
    of the drawing commands.  Note however, that except for the
    SURFACES and LINES commands, after you set the first point for each
    drawing entity, the drawing plane will lock to that plane until the
    single entity has been drawn.
               

EDIT MENU

    This menu gives you the commands required to either erase drawing
    elements or change their color.  To ERASE a LINE segment, SURFACE,
    or ENTITY, you'll be prompted to select the item - point to it on
    the screen with the mouse cursor, and click the left button.  For
    surfaces, you'll also be prompted to pick an additional edge, this
    enables the program to identify the desired surface more
    accurately. To erase an OBJECT or GROUP, you'll simply select its'
    name from the menu.  And ERASE ALL allows you to erase everything
    in the drawing all at one time.

    All or the Erase commands display a confirmation menu before the
    item is actually deleted.  Additionally, the item will be
    highlighted on screen for identification.
               
    EDIT COLOR enables you to select and change the color of any LINE
    segment, SURFACE, ENTITY, OBJECT, or GROUP.


EXTRUDE MENU

    The EXTRUDE commands enable a 2D object constructed of either
    Lines, Polygons, or Arcs to be automatically expanded into a 3D
    object made of surfaces.  You'll first be prompted to select the
    name of the object you wish to extrude, after which you can then
    select the direction for the extrusion.  Extrusions can be either
    Relative or Absolute.
    
    A RELATIVE extrusion will extrude a surface a given distance from
    the line segment being extruded.  This method enables you to create
    angle extrusions from objects that have been rotated.  The length
    of each line segment is determined by the DISTANCE value.
    
    The ABSOLUTE extrusion method will extrude a surface directly to a
    specific coordinate value.  When using an Absolute extrusion, the
    DISTANCE value becomes an  actual coordinate value.  This lets you
    create objects for example, with irregular heights, yet extrude
    them to a common coordinate length.
               

FILES MENU

    The Files Menu contains the commands for the saving and retrieval
    of various file types.  NEW FILENAME lets you change the name of
    the file you are working on.  The next time you save the file,
    it'll be saved using this new filename.  Any saves made using the
    previous filename still remain on disk under the old filename.

    MERGE \DRW is used to retrieve a drawing file from the Drawings
    Directory, and merge it with the current drawing.  MERGE \LIB does
    the same thing, only it lets you merge files from the Library
    Directory.  The Merge commands treat the incoming file as a new
    object, and will automatically assign it to a new object
    designation.  The name given to the object will be that of the
    filename.
               
    EXTRACT \DRW and EXTRACT \LIB is used to save a selected object or
    group of objects to a separate file in the respective directory.
               
    SAVE \DRW and SAVE \LIB will save the current drawing to disk in
    the respective directory.  The F12 Key can also be used to save
    your file from any other menu in the program.
               
    CREATE .PLG will create a Rend386 Virtual Reality file of the
    current drawing.  The file will be saved into the directory you
    have previously specified as your Rend386 files directory.


GROUP MENU

    The commands on the Group Menu allow you to link objects together
    in order to control them as one item.  LINK OBJECTS is used to pick
    your objects and link them to a group.  Like objects, groups are
    also given names.  To start a new group, select the [] symbols,
    then enter a name for the new group.

    The UNLINK OBJ command enables you to unlink a selected object, or
    objects, from a chosen group without affecting the other objects
    already part of that group designation.

    RENAME lets you change the name of a group.  You simply select the
    name of the group you wish to change, then enter the new name.
               
    RESET GROUP unlinks all objects from a chosen group, and resets the
    group name to the [] symbols.  RESET ALL unlinks all objects from
    ALL of the groups, and resets all group names to the [] symbols.
               
    IDENTIFY will temporarily highlight a selected group in your
    drawing.  This command allows you to see which objects are part of
    the selected group.
               

MAIN MENU

    This is the opening menu of the 3D Drawing Editor.  (The majority
    of the commands on this menu access other submenus).

    VIEWPOINT enables you to select a 3-D viewpoint.  By moving the
    mouse, position your viewpoint in reference to the axes tripod,
    then click the left mouse button.  The F9 Key can be used to change
    the degree increments if desired.
               
    MODEL displays the Modeling Menu, which contains the commands for
    positioning and manipulating objects.  DRAW displays the Draw Menu,
    which contains the commands for creating entities such as Surfaces,
    Polygons, and Arcs.  EDIT displays the Edit Menu.  The commands to
    erase items from the drawing are located on this menu, as well as
    commands for changing their color.
               
    FILES displays the Files Menu.  Here you'll find commands
    pertaining to file operations, such as merging, extracting, and
    saving drawing files.  The command for translating your drawing to
    a Rend386 .PLG file is also on this submenu.
               
    OBJECTS displays the Objects Menu which contains the commands for
    redesignating entities and permanently combining objects.  GROUPS
    displays the Group Menu.  This menu contains the commands which
    enable you to link and unlink objects with each other for
    manipulation.
               
    SETTINGS displays the Settings Menu.  Commands which set some of
    the drawing variables are located on this menu.  BACKGROUND allows
    you to specify a color for the image background.  QUIT will display
    a confirmation menu for exiting the 3D Drawing Editor.
               

MODEL MENU

    This menu contains the commands for positioning and manipulating
    objects.

    VIEWPOINT enables you to select a 3-D viewpoint.  By moving the
    mouse, position your viewpoint in reference to the axes tripod,
    then click the left mouse button.  The F9 Key can be used to change
    the degree increments if desired.
               
    MOVE initiates access to the Move Menu.  You'll first be asked to
    pick the item you want to move.  Items you can move include:
    Objects, Groups, a specific Endpoint, the entire drawing, or
    Endpoints selected with a rubber-banding window.
               
    SCALE initiates access to the Scale Menu.  You'll first be asked to
    pick the item you want to scale.  Items you can scale include:
    Objects, Groups, and the entire drawing.
               
    ROTATE initiates access to the Rotate Menu.  You can rotate either
    an Object, or a Group.
               
    EXTRUDE initiates access to the Extrude Menu, where you can turn 2D
    objects into 3D objects made of surfaces.
               
    REVOLVE initiates access to the Revolve Menu, where you can turn 2D
    contour objects into 3D cylindrical objects made of surfaces.
               
    COPY initiates access to the Copy Menu, where you can make copies
    of objects or groups of objects.
               

MOVE MENU

    This menu gives you control over repositioning various items in
    your drawing.  First you'll be asked to choose what you would like
    to move.  You can select either an individual OBJECT or GROUP, as
    well as EVERYTHING in the drawing.  Additionally, the ENDPOINT
    option allows you to pick a single point (usually a surface vertex)
    to move.  WINDOW PTS lets you pick several points to move together
    at one time.  Using a rubber-banding rectangle, you draw a boundary
    around the points you want to move.  Only the selected points
    within the rectangle will move during each move operation.

    The LEFT, RIGHT, FORWARD, BACKWARD, UP, and DOWN commands will move
    the item in the respective direction.  The distance of each
    movement can be selected by the INCREMENT, or you can use the two
    default distances of 200 or 500.
               
    If you wish to select another item to move, the MOVE ITEM command
    will take you back to the first Move Menu where you can choose the
    next item.  SCALE ITEM enables you to jump directly to the Scale
    Menu, and continue manipulating the same object or group you were
    using on the Move Menu.  Note however, the Scale Item option only
    appears on the Move Menu if you're moving Objects or Groups, and
    not endpoints.
               
    Notes: Only the item being moved is redrawn after each movement, so
    lines of other objects may at times become partially erased.  Issue
    a Redraw with the F10 Key to clean up the drawing when desired.
               
    The center of 3-D drawing space is at X,Y,Z coordinate: 0,0,0 and
    the drawing space plus contingency space extends 7,000 units in
    each direction.  Try to keep your drawing within the boundaries of
    -3300 to +3300, since this is the maximum size of the viewport.


OBJECTS MENU

    LINK ENTITY gives you the ability to reassign entities to another
    object.  As you create a drawing, the entities are assigned to the
    current Work Object.  This command lets you separate entities out
    of one object and assign them to another, whether to an existing
    object or a new object.  You'll first be prompted to pick the
    entity for redesignation, then to select the name of the object you
    want the entity assigned.  You can also select the [] symbols if
    you want the entity to become part of a new object.

    RENAME lets you change the name of a previous object.  Select the
    name of the object you wish to change, then enter the new name for
    the object.
               
    COMBINE allows you to permanently combine multiple objects into a
    single object designation.  First, you'll select the destination
    object, then you'll select the object you wish to combine with the
    destination object.  After selecting the object, the name of the
    freed object is reset to the [] symbols.  (Note: if you want to
    temporarily combine objects in order to simply manipulate them as a
    whole, use the Group commands, not the Object Combine command).
               
    IDENTIFY will temporarily highlight a selected object in your
    drawing.  This command is a good way to familiarize yourself with
    the objects in a file that you haven't worked on in awhile, or was
    obtained from another designer.
               
               
REVOLVE MENU

    The Revolve function enables a 2D object constructed of either
    Lines, Polygons, or Arcs to be used as a contour for the creation
    of a 3D cylindrical object.  Surfaces are automatically generated
    by rotating the contour around the Z-axis.

    REVOLVE executes the function.  The program will generate surface
    extrusions using the current values for Sweep, Sections, Spiral,
    and Expansion.
               
    SWEEP sets the degree of rotation for the extrusion.  For example,
    360 will create a completely cylindrical object.  Sweep values
    beyond 360 are intended for use when Spiral and/or Expansion
    settings are also being used.
               
    SECTIONS specifies the number of surface sections to create during
    the Sweep.  This gives you control over the surface resolution of
    the object.
               
    SPIRAL lets you set a unit increment that's used for a vertical
    offset during the creation of new surfaces.  As each new section is
    created, Spiral shifts the next section higher than the previous.
    This effect creates objects that resemble a spring.
               
    EXPANSION sets a unit increment that's used for a horizontal offset
    during the creation of the new surfaces.  As new sections are
    created, Expansion shifts the next section farther out from the
    previous section.  This effect creates objects that resemble a
    coil.
               
               
ROTATE MENU

    Individual Objects or Groups of Objects can be independently
    rotated along any axis.  After you select the item you wish to
    rotate, the rotate commands will be displayed.  Each time you
    select one of the Rotate commands, the program will calculate the
    item's center point, and rotate it around this point.  After each
    rotation, the degree display below the menu will also be updated to
    reflect the direction, and the degrees, the object has be rotated
    during this command operation.

    ROTATE LEFT rotates the item around its height axis to the left.
    Whereas, ROTATE RIGHT rotates the item to the right.
               
    TIP UP rotates the item around its width axis in an upward
    direction.  Whereas, TIP DOWN rotates it downward.
               
    TILT LEFT rotates the item around its length axis to the left.
    Whereas, TILT RIGHT rotates it to the right.
               
    INCREMENT lets you to specify the rotation degree increment.
    ROTATE ITEM lets you select a different item for rotation.
               
    Note: Like the Move and Scale commands, only the item being rotated
    is redrawn after each rotate operation.  Lines of other objects may
    at times become partially erased.  Issue a Redraw with the F10 Key
    to clean up the drawing as needed.
               

SCALE MENU

    This menu gives you control over the scaling of various items in
    your drawing.  First you'll be asked to choose the item you want to
    scale, you can select either an individual OBJECT or GROUP, as well
    as EVERYTHING in the drawing.

    The SMALLER and LARGER commands will scale the item respectively.
    The factor by which the item is scaled is set by the INCREMENT, or
    you can use the two default scale factors of .99 or .75.
               
    You can also control the Scale Type.  ALL SIDES is used to indicate
    that all the sides of the item are to be scaled by the same scale
    factor simultaneously.  HEIGHT ONLY indicates only the height (Z-
    axis) is to be scaled.  WIDTH ONLY is used to indicate that only
    the width (X-axis) is to be scaled.  And LENGTH ONLY indicates that
    only the length (Y-axis) is to be scaled.
               
    If you wish to select another item to scale, the SCALE ITEM command
    will take you back to the first Scale Menu where you can choose the
    another item.  MOVE ITEM enables you to jump directly to the Move
    Menu, and continue manipulating the same object or group you're
    using on the Scale Menu.
               
    Notes: Only the item being scaled is redrawn after each scale
    operation, so lines of other objects may at times become partially
    erased.  Issue a Redraw with the F10 Key to clean up the drawing
    when desired.
               
    NOTES: The scale commands are used to alter the actual coordinate
    data, don't confuse this command with the Zoom command, which does
    not alter any of the drawing coordinates.
               

SETTINGS MENU

    This menu provides you with some custom drawing options. ARC RES
    enables you to set the line segment resolution for Arc entities.
    The resolution represents the number of line segments around the
    circumference.  The resolution setting is not global, so you can
    therefore change resolution based on the priority and visibility of
    the object you're creating.

    CURSOR SIZE allows you to pick one of five graphics cursor sizes.
    User preference will more likely determine which one you use. Note
    however, that the larger the cursor, the greater the demand on
    video processing.  This is especially true for systems running
    1024x768 256 color displays.
               
    SNAP ZONE sets the zone around the graphics cursor and the mouse
    cursor that's tested during Snap and pick functions.  The more
    entities in the drawing, the more time it takes to process the
    drawing database for possible selection.  The Snap Zone lets you
    tell the program, based on your own preference, and perhaps the
    speed of your computer, how large an area to test.  Items not in
    the zone are not tested, thereby saving calculation time.  The
    range can be between 250 and 1000, and represents the distance in
    each direction from cursor.
               
    Note: The setting variables are saved with each file.  You can
    therefore use different settings for certain types of drawings.
               



   -----------------------------------------------------------------
            * * * * * * *     APPENDICES     * * * * * * *
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

APPENDIX A: THE DEFAULTS.NC3 FILE
---------------------------------

Whenever a new drawing is started, NorthCAD-3D automatically loads a
template file to initialize the default settings for the new file.
DEFAULTS.NC3 is that template file.

The file is just like any other drawing file, and that's what makes it
so useful.  If you find yourself always using certain settings and
option values at the start of a new drawing, you can simply change the
settings in this file, and they'll be used as the new defaults.  To
make changes to the template file:

     Load the template file directly from the file listing menu,
     just as if you were loading an existing drawing file.

     Make your desired changes to the settings.

     Save the file to both the Drawings and Library Directories
     
     Exit back to the main program module.

The next time you start a NEW drawing, the settings in the template
file will be used to initialize the new drawing.

If you discover that you're always merging in the same library file
after you start a new drawing, you can also make that automatic too.
Just merge the library file into the template file and save the
template file the same way as described above.  Whatever objects are in
the template file will also be included in the start of your new
drawing file.  You can therefore start new drawings that already have
your commonly used library objects in them and ready to use.

NOTE: If you change drawing or library file directories, be sure to
copy the template file to the new directory, it must remain accessible
to the program whenever a new drawing or library file is started.




APPENDIX B: USING LIBRARY FILES
-------------------------------

NorthCAD-3D lets you use standard graphic elements of objects over and
over again without having to redraw them each time they are needed.  By
creating separate files containing specific shapes and objects, you can
merge them into your drawing whenever you need them.

This concept of using graphics Libraries greatly reduces the time
required to draw your images, as well as increase your ability to
construct more creative and elaborate 3D drawings.

To create files that can be used as Library files, you can use any one,
or all, of these methods:

METHOD 1: Start a new drawing and create your desired graphic element
using the Drawing and/or Modeling commands.  Then, save the file to the
Library Directory.

METHOD 2:  Start a new drawing and create your desired graphic element
by not only using the drawing commands, but also some of your
previously completed Library files.  Merging, and then combining them
with your drawing, you can create even more sophisticated objects to
use solely as Library files.  Then, as in Method 1, save the drawing to
the Library Directory, and use the file specifically as a library file.

METHOD 3: Use the EXTRACT command to save objects you create while
working on a current drawing, thereby building your collection of
Library files as you work.

APPENDIX E: ERROR MESSAGES
--------------------------

The following is a list of error messages used by NorthCAD-3D.

Bad Filename

     The filename contains characters that are invalid. Consult your
     DOS manual. Also, you don't need to include the filename
     extensions when entering a filename.  Also, check for proper
     syntax of the directory and path.

Configuration File: CONFIG1.CFG not found
through
Configuration File: CONFIG7.CFG not found

     The CONFIGn.CFG files contain program settings and configuration
     information, and must be kept in the same directory as the program
     files.

Device unavailable

     An attempt was made to access a device that is either not "on-
     line" or does not exist. For example, setting a directory
     specification to "D:" when in fact, a D drive is not in the
     computer.

Disk is full, unable to save file

     NorthCAD-3D attempted to write a file on a disk which contains
     insufficient free space. Replace the disk with another that
     contains more free space and retry the command.

Disk media error

     An attempt was made to write or read a file from your disk.  This
     error indicates your disk may be defective. Consult your DOS
     manual for procedures to check your disk.

Disk not ready

     An attempt was made to write or read a file from your disk.  Check
     to be sure the drive door is closed properly.

Disk write protect

     An attempt was made to save a file to your disk and encountered a
     write protect label, remove it and retry the command.

File not found

     The file you specified could not be found.  Retry the command and
     be sure the file is listed in the directory.  If you're starting a
     new drawing or library file, be sure that the template file:
     DEFAULTS.NC3 is in both the Drawing Directory, and the Library
     Directory.

File: DEFAULTS.NC3 not found

     When starting a new drawing, the default settings in the drawing
     file: DEFAULTS.NC3 are loaded into memory and become the initial
     drawing template for your new drawing. A copy of DEFAULTS.NC3 must
     be kept in both your Drawings Directory and Library Directory.

Graphics display configuration error

     The program is not configured properly for your display adapter
     and monitor.  Check to be sure you have set the appropriate
     resolution and color configuration, and that your display adapter
     uses one of the supported SVGA chipsets.

Incompatible File

     The specified file is not NorthCAD-3D Version 9.5VR compatible.

Internal error 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, or 106

     An error has occurred which may require more in-depth technical
     support than the User Guide can solve.

Invalid Directory

     The directory specification is not correct. Check to be sure the
     proper syntax is being used, see program configuration for more
     information about specifying directories.

Maximum drawing memory

     You have executed a command that would exceed the current maximum
     memory limits of the program on your system.  The percentage of
     memory currently used can be found in the Settings Area, just
     below the Draw Menu, next to the MEM% display.  NorthCAD-3D uses
     conventional RAM, and the total size of your drawing is dependent
     upon how much free RAM is available.  You can free up RAM by
     loading your DOS "high" and removing memory resident software
     prior to running NorthCAD-3D.

Modeling Program Module: NC3DVR.EXE not found.

     The 3-D Modeling Module must reside on the same disk, or in the
     same directory, as the Main Program Module: NCVR.EXE

Temporary work file: TEMPFILE.WRK not found

     NorthCAD-3D maintains a temporary work file for the transfer
     between one program module to another.  This error will likely
     occur if you try to run the Modeling Module on its own.  Operate
     the NorthCAD-3D program only through the Main Program Module:
     NCVR.EXE.
