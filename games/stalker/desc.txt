In a world contaminated by the radiation of a nuclear power plant accident, you are a "Stalker."  Much of the land is highly radioactive and mutated creatures roam in search of food.  You look pretty tasty to them.  As a Stalker, you wander from zone to zone, seeking nourishment and what treasure you can find.  There are many hazards along the way.  
In order to move to the next level, you have to gain enough points to access the "exit zone."  Destroy the creatures that come after you, avoid the "radiation zones", the radioactive pools, and try to keep going.  Remember, you're a Stalker, and only the strong, and the smart, survive.  
Spectacular graphics and sound enhance your trek through the zones.  If you are good, really good, you just might find the golden sphere that grants any wish.  
Until then, you're a Stalker, and it's you ... against the odds.
