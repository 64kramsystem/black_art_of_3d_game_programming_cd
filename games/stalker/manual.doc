DESCRIPTION:


      This is the brief instruction of THE STALKER game 
      (the first episode - PATH OF FIRE)

      There is a map. This map corresponds to levels from number 
      1 to 12.
      When player goes through any level he returns to the map.
      The map indicates the current location of a player and further route.
      A player can select the next level according to a route (sometimes he 
      has a choice where to go). Each map can have few different (random) 
      routes.

         From each level, a player can press F1 to see Help.

         Each level has three zones :
                    1. Zone where Stalker can move   
                    2. Radiation zone
                    3. Exit
         On each level coordinates of these zones are different.  


         When Stalker enters a radiation zone, the screen starts flickering.
         This indicates a danger situation for the Stalker.
         If the Stalker stays too long in the radiation zone, he will fall 
         and lose part of his life. He should get out of this zone 
         as soon as possible.            
           
         The Stalker has a machine gun and bullets;  however, there is a 
         limit of bullets.
    
         There are few different types of obstacles that the Stalker
         should overcome on each level :
                
            1. A live moving enemy. They are trying to get as close
               as possible to the Stalker. When they get close to the
               Stalker they try to kill him in different ways
               (bite him, stab him, etc).
               
               There are two type of enemies : 
                             -  one chasing
                             -  one moving in specific directions

               The Stalker can shoot them if he has bullets. If he kills
               an enemy, he gets points. If he kills more enemies,
               he gets more points.
               To kill some, enemies Stalker needs to shoot them twice.
               Some enemies he has to shoot them three times,
               for others - just once.
               Each level contains different enemies.       
                
            2. There are zones where Stalker will be limited to a certain
               period of time (For example - holes, swamps, etc).
               When Stalker enters such area, specific music starts to
               play and Stalker starts to drown. He has a limited time to
               get out from this area before he drowns. 
               If Stalker drowns he would lose half of his health and 
               Stalker would return to the map and start this level from
               the very beginning.
   
            3. There are two different types of key. 
               
               If Stalker picks up the first type of key, he would be able
               to open a box with bullets (to get more bullets) or box
               with drugs (to get more health). 
               But he can only open one box.
               
               Second type of key - "Exit" key - appears when Stalker 
               gets a big number of points (it means he killed a specific 
               number of enemies on this level, and in a place where the last 
               enemy was killed, a key appears). When Stalker picks up this 
               key, he can go through Exit zone back to the map and then to 
               the next level.

             4. There are "catch" stones. It means if Stalker steps into
                an area of these stones, he can not get out.
                He can get away from these "catch" stones if he jumps
                left or right.
                
             5. There are things that Stalker can pick up with "random" effects.
                "Random" effect means that Stalker does not know what happens
                when he picks up these things. One time he can pick up 
                something and get points. Another time he can pick up 
                the same thing and lose part of his health. 
                Sometimes he can get a key.
             
             6. There is the "deadly" ball. Some enemies shoot this "deadly" 
                ball at Stalker. Stalker has to elude this ball
                as fast as possible. If this ball hits Stalker he will
                lose part of his life.
