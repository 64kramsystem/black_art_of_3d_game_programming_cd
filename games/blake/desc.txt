In this futuristic game, your mission is to secretly explore the "Space Technology And Research" (STAR) Institute of one Dr. Goldfire, an intelligent but demented researcher in genetic experiments. As British agent, Blake Stone, you must put a stop to Dr. Goldfire's evil plans.
British intelligence doesn't know much about what goes on inside the STAR Institute, it's your job is to find out. Luckily, British intelligence has scientist-informants in the STAR Institue to help you out on your quest. During your mission, you will encounter smart opponents who try to thwart your efforts, computer terminals with access to Dr. Goldfire's information network, and alien creatures exploding from pods, emerging from electrical outlets, or oozing across the floor.
