Installation
------------
If you downloaded this file from a BBS, you don't need to run Install.  If you
purchased an evaluation disk from a shareware vendor or the story, follow these
directions.  To install Desert Storm Command, place the diskette into the A
drive and type A:, or into the B drive and type B:.  When the A> or B> prompt
appears on the screen, type INSTALL.  Follow the directions to install the
software.

Note that you must have your mouse and the DOS mouse driver installed to run
this game.  If you normally use the mouse with Windows programs, remember that
the Windows mouse driver does not work with DOS programs.  (Blame Microsoft
for this, not us.)  You need to run the MOUSE.COM program before running
Desert Storm Command if your mouse driver is not installed.  This can be
found on the disk that came with your mouse.

To begin the game type DSC.

Note to Windows Users
---------------------
Desert Storm Command will run as a DOS application, spawned under Windows, but
you may encounter sound card conflicts.  The best solution if you run into
conflicts is to completely exit from Windows before starting Desert Storm
Command.  Clicking on the DOS prompt is NOT exiting Windows.  You must
actually close your Windows session.

Desert Storm Command and Sound Blaster 16
-----------------------------------------
The Sound Blaster 16 sound card causes special problems, especially in 486 DX2
systems.  If the game locks up, try running it without digitized sound effects.
Another option is to include the following command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT:
  
    SET SB-SET FM:9,9

This command may also make the music louder if it is too soft on your SB 16.

Making a clean boot disk
------------------------
If you encounter problems running Desert Storm Command there may be a
conflict between it and a program resident in memory.  Here's a way to avoid
the conflict.

Place a blank, unformatted diskette into drive A of your computer.  Then type

            FORMAT A:/S/U

and press enter.  When the computer is finished formatting the disk and
copying the system files to it, press the RESET button on your computer or the
ALT-CTRL-DEL keys at the same time.  After your computer has rebooted, go to
the Desert Storm Command directory and play the game.  If it runs, there is a
conflict between a resident program loaded by your AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS
file.  Whenever you want to play Desert Storm Command, simply reboot your
computer with the boot disk you have created.

Introduction
------------
Desert Storm Command is an arcade-style game that puts you in the conflict in
the Persian Gulf.  This game comprises 20 missions.  Missions take place all
over the gulf region and require you to meet certain objectives to pass on to
the next mission.  There are two basic mission types to contend with in the
shareware version: Combat & Scuds.

The Main Menu
-------------
When the game starts, it enters a demonstration mode which will show you both
of the basic mission types.  When you have finished viewing the demonstration,
click the left mouse button to go to the main menu.  The main menu has seven
different options which are as follows:

(1) Play Game - This option  will actually start a new game, beginning with
Mission number one.

(2) Practice - This option will allow you to practice either of the basic
mission types.  When the practice menu screen comes up, click the left mouse
button on the mission type you want to practice.  Notice that there are four
choices in this menu.  The choices labelled "TOMAHAWKS" and "TANKS" are not
available in the shareware version of this game.  Refer to the section
discussing Desert Storm Command Deluxe for more about these mission types.

(3) Load Game - When playing a game, if you achieve the minimum objective to
advance to the next level, you will be offered a chance to save the game at
that point.  Doing so will allow you to either continue play at a later time
or resume at this same point should you not meet the objectives for the
coming round.  To make reaching the finale more of a challenge, after the
15th level, the save option is not offered.  When the "Save Game?" prompt
appears, hit the Y key.  Note: There is only one saved game at a time so be
careful not to overwrite a 14th level save with a 3rd level save.

(4) Instructions - This section not only gives you a brief overview of the
program, it also takes you through both of the mission types, step-by-step.
Note: A "Click mouse button or hit any key" prompt is displayed for the first
few screens but is not from then on.  Be aware that the help section will
wait for you to tell it to advance.

(5) Game Settings - This section will allow you to set the program up the way
you like it.  After clicking on this option, you will see the Game Settings
menu.  Within this menu you can: (1) Turn music on & off (2) Turn sound
effects on and off (3) Adjust the music and sound volumes and (4) set the
game difficulty from easy to extremely hard.

(6) Hall of Fame - This is a record of the 10 highest scoring players.  When
a new high score is achieved, you will be asked to enter your name.  In
addition to the score, the Hall of Fame also reports the level reached,
difficulty used, whether the game was finished (level 20), and whether the
scorer ever saved the game.  Since saving games will allow you to start over
at that point, individuals who play the game straight through are duly noted
for their courageous efforts!  If you desire to start a new high score table,
simply delete the file called "DSC.SCR".

(7) Quit - Exits Desert Storm Command and returns you to DOS.

Getting Started
---------------
When you run Desert Storm Command for the first time, you will be asked
whether or not you want to run the game in bloodless mode.  This is due to
the bloody nature of the combat scenarios.  If you choose YES, the combat
missions will not display the blood during shooting.  You will also be
informed of what to do if your machine is slow enough to cause problems or if
there are some sound card conflicts that may cause lock-ups.  After getting
through this section the first time, you won't be annoyed with the questions
subsequently.  If you wish to change the bloodless setting, you can always
delete the file called DSC.SAV and run the program again.  All other settings
can be changed in the GAME SETTINGS menu.

Combat Missions
---------------
The combat missions throw you into the heat of hand-to-hand battle.  When the
mission begins, you will see men start to run across the bottom of the screen
from left to right.  These are the men in your troop and you must protect
them.  Meanwhile, men will start appearing in window sills, bushes, and even
foxholes.  Unbeknownst to everyone but you, your troop has stumbled into an
ambush!  You must eliminate these snipers before they take pot-shots at your
men.  As the levels advance, more and more men will appear at the same time.
Fortunately for you, your weapons will advance as well.  When you start the
game you are using an M-9 pistol.  Each shot must be carefully aimed.  As you
eventually work your way towards an M-60, multiple shots are fired for each
pull of the trigger.  Of your original troop, at least half of them must make
it across the screen alive for you to advance in the game.  Troop sizes vary
from 12 to 30, so be prepared for some long engagements.

Scud Missions
-------------
The scud missions put you in charge of the Patriot Missile Defense System.
You will use your Patriot missiles to eliminate wave after wave of enemy scud
missiles, choppers, and jets.  Foremost, and by far most important, are the
scud missiles.  Move your crosshairs across the screen and click the left
mouse button repeatedly to send up Patriots to intercept the scuds as they
rain down on intended targets.  When the occasional chopper comes out, you
should eliminate it as early as possible.  If the chopper is left alone, it
will drop a bomb which does damage to the targets below.  The bomb does about
half of the damage done by a single scud missile, so it is clearly not as
important.  If you can spare the time, though, the chopper is certainly
easier to hit than the bombs are.

You will also periodically see an enemy jet stray onto the screen.  The jets
are worth a lot of points, but since they do no damage, you can ignore them.
This is always good advice when you have your hands full with a volley of
scuds.  Every scud missile that you fail to intercept will cause damage to
the cities and installations below.  Your primary goal in these missions is
to maintain the status of these installations at 50% or more.  Pay close
attention to your status bar in the top left corner of the screen.  When the
status bar turns yellow, it is a warning that you are in danger of
approaching the 50% mark.  When this status bar turns red, it means that you
have exceeded the 50% mark and the game will end after this mission.

Game Playing Tips
-----------------
Combat Missions: At times this section will get a bit difficult.  On the
foxhole screen, if your hands are full, you may want to choose to ignore the
guy in the foxhole since he is in such a remote location.  Likewise for the
guy in the bushes on the red-building screen.  Sometimes the time taken to
get your crosshairs over to them will cost you more men than just ignoring
them will.  Also, as the missions get more intense, fortunately the skill
of the snipers worsens.  For example, in the early missions the sniper will
hit his target on 1 out of every 2 shots.  Later, this may go to 1 out of 5.
This doesn't make it too easy on you, though, since there are so many snipers
then.

Scud Missions: When the scud density is high, you may have to sacrifice a
portion of the screen.  Decide where the largest portion of buildings are,
protect them at all cost, and you should succeed.

During scud missions, if you can afford the time, hit choppers when they first
appear.  Never do this, though, at the cost of letting a scud hit its target.

Mission Tables
--------------
Note: The term "random Seed" in the tables below refers to frequency with
which either choppers or jets can appear.  This value ranges from 0 to 255
with the following qualities:

     0 - The jet or chopper never appears on this level
     1 - The jet or chopper is almost constantly appearing
     .
     .
   255 - The jet or chopper rarely appears

Difficulty Tables
-----------------
The following tables will reflect how the difficulty settings change the
various features of each level.  The double-dashed line means that there is
no change in that statistic whereas a value will change this feature in the
way described.  For example, If you have the difficulty set to EXTREME,
mission number 2 will have 3 scuds at a time and will not end until 45 scuds
have been destroyed by you or the ground!  At the end of your game you will
be rewarded 0, 50,000, 100,000 or 200,000 points, depending on the difficulty
level you have played.
