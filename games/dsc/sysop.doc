               Introducing the MVP Distribution Network

Have you heard about the MVP Distribution Network?  MVP Software is joining
forces with BBS sysops in a joint effort that will help both of us.  I'd like
to invite you to become a member of the MVPDN.  Here's how it can benefit you.

Near and dear to all sysops' hearts are callers.  If you run a subscription
BBS, then more callers means more money.  If you run a free BBS, then more
callers means that more people are finding what they want on your system.
Participating in the MVPDN will increase the traffic on your board.

Participating sysops in the MVPDN receive all of our popular games and
entertainment-related shareware directly from MVP Software, before it is
available on other boards or from shareware disk vendors.

What about the quality of our games?  Good question.  AOL chose Sand Storm as
a Top Pick for September 1992.  PsL News chose both Robomaze II and Robomaze
III as the top new arcade games of 1991, tied with several Apogee games.
Corncob 3D, our award-winning flight sim, was nominated in two categories by
the Shareware Industry Awards, received an Editor's Choice in Shareware
Magazine, and has been favorably reviewed in PC/Games, Nuts and Volts, In
Flight, Computer Gaming World, and several other publications.  Several of our
games have also been chosen as cover disks by European computer publications.
Retail versions of our games (often identical to the shareware versions) have
sold as many as 50,000 copies in less than a year.

And the best is yet to come.  We now have over 20 talented development teams.
In 1994 we have released our first shareware educational game, the Sea School
Series.  Designed by a teacher, it combines education, outstanding graphics,
and fun for early learners like never before in shareware.  Bloody April, our
next-generation 256-color air combat game has features not found in most
commercial flight sims.  And we have released our first of several Windows
games.

Don't miss out!  Be the first BBS in your area to carry these hot new
shareware products!  These are just some of the reasons to join the MVPDN now
and grow with us.  It's easy to join the MVP Distribution Network.  Here's
what you do.

1. Not all boards qualify to be a distribution site for MVP Software.  We
   would love to have them all, but since we mail all new releases and updates
   directly to each sysop, the cost is prohibitive.  So to qualify, your board
   MUST be online 24 hours a day.  I'm sorry, but we can't support part-time
   boards.

2. Call MVP's home BBS, Ryan's Bar, at 616-456-1845 or 616-456-5342.  Download
   all the files in the MVP file section.  These are the files you should post
   on your board in the MVP section.  If you have trouble getting through,
   call Exec-PC at (414) 789-4360 and download the MVP files from the free
   MVP file section.

3. After you call to download the files, call Dave Snyder voice at
   (616) 245-8376 so we can add you to our database.  It is best if you
   use a high-speed modem to download the files.  It will take you a long
   time at 2400 baud. <g>
   
4. Create a file section on your system called MVP SOFTWARE.  This file
   section will contain all MVP shareware products.

5. Post the MVP bulletin and the MVP log-on message on your board to let
   your users know you are a distribution site.  These are contained in the
   SYSOP.MVP file.

6. We will notify you of new releases and updates.  You will also receive our
   periodic sysop newsleter, MVPDN News.

And that's all there is to it!  I hope you will join us today.
