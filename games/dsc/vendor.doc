             digitized sound, and a sizzling original musical score add up to
             make this the best Gulf War arcade game of them all!  Strap on

Catalog vendors: Please include Desert Storm Command in your printed and disk
                 shareware catalogs.  For best sales results use one of the
                 above descriptions.  In addition, all MVP product listings
                 MUST include the words "by MVP Software" or "an MVP Software
                 production."  This encourages repeat sales, which is good for
                 both of us.  The only exception to this is if the catalog has
                 a separate MVP Software section.  No vendor may charge a fee
                 of more than $8.00 for the shareware version of this product.
                 Vendors are encouraged to contact MVP Software directly to get
                 the latest version of the product and to be added to our
                 mailing list for direct mailings of updates & future releases.

Rackware vendors and CD-ROM publishers: Please read our rackware and CD-ROM
                                        distribution policy below.

Desert Storm Command may be distributed via BBSs, shareware printed or on-disk
catalogs, and at swap meets, flea markets or computer shows.  For all other
forms of shareware distribution please contact Dave Snyder at MVP Software for
