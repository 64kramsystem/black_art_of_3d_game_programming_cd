SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS
=====================
[1]  Apogee owns the right to control the distribution and selling of
     our GAME SOFTWARE, and we can (for any reason) select who can and
     who cannot sell and distribute our GAME SOFTWARE.
[2]  All advertising of any Apogee game must include "Apogee" in the
     description.
[3]  If you want to sell GAME SOFTWARE in a retail location (such as
     on a rack), if you want to bundle our games, or if you sell want
     to sell our games on CD-ROM, you must get written permission from
     Apogee FIRST.
[4]  Selling Apogee's GAME SOFTWARE through a catalog, advertisement,
     BBS, on-line service, or direct mailing is allowable without prior
     permission from Apogee.  It is highly recommended that vendors of
     Apogee's games acquire our software from an authorized source,
     such as our home BBS (Software Creations BBS: 508-365-2359) or
     directly from Apogee, to prevent the selling of older versions.
[5]  Customers and players of Apogee's shareware games may freely copy
     and pass around our shareware software, without charging a fee.
     (Apogee's shareware is always episode one of a series of related
     games.  The remaining episodes in a series are NOT SHAREWARE, and
     must not be distributed or sold other than by Apogee or by an
     authorized distributor.)
