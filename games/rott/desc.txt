Rise of the Triad:The Hunt Begins, is a game with spectacular graphics and sound.  
One of the best games you'll ever see.  In the game, you are part of an elite group of operatives called HUNT (High-risk United Nations Taskforce), and you must stop a maniac cult leader from killing millions of people.  
While scouting a remote island, you are suddenly surrounded by enemy troops with guns blaring.  In the distance you see your boat--your only chance to escape--explode into matchsticks.  
In front of you is a huge fortress monastery, and your only chance to stop the madness. You are equipped with awesome, high-tech weaponry like heat-seeking missiles, split missiles, and the FlameWall cannon, which leaves a trail of charred skeletons in its wake. You'll also find magical instruments and weapons so incredible they defy description.  The Hunt Begins is a challenge to all game players.  
Check your weapon.  Look over your shoulder.  Now, move out!
