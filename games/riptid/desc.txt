Riptide is an exciting underwater adventure game.  Just surviving is a challenge, but each level is a puzzle as well.  
You'll need to navigate underwater passages, explore undersea caves, find the key, and get to safety!  Hop in your sub, grab your submersible side-kick, Jason, and dive into Riptide!  You must find the exit!  
As you explore the depths you'll have to watch out for a wide range of nasty creatures of the deep.  You'll also have to keep a close eye on your air supply and the strength of your shields.  As you wander through the abyss, seeking the exit, blast away at barrels to find extra modules of power and air to help keep you going. There's treasure to be found as well, and modules that will increase your firepower!  Find all the pieces of the photon gun and you'll have a really powerful weapon to protect yourself with.  
Jason, your tiny submersible buddy, follows along beside you, ready to go into action. Jason can detach from your main sub and boldly go into places too small for your main sub, gathering treasure and triggering underwater buttons.  
You'll have to fight and think your way out in order to survive Riptide! Riptide has excellent graphics and realistic sound effects.  
A superior game from Pack Media!
