- - - - - INTRODUCTION

Turoid is a break-out type game.  The purpose of the game is to
destroy all the green, orange, and white bricks on the screen.  The concept
is similar to other ball-paddle games, but with many different features.
For example, in Turoid, you can have up to 64 balls simultaneously on
the screen, bonus shoot'em up levels, and a Level Editor.  In short,
Turoid is like other break-out games, but DIFFERENT.



- - - - - SYSTEM REQUIREMENT

Turoid is graphics intensive.  The faster your computer the better.
Here's the minimum configuration:

	* 286 processor
	* VGA/MCGA video card
	* a mouse
	
	Recommended

	* 386sx or higher
	* Adlib or compatible sound cards (SoundBlaster, ProAudio...)



- - - - - GAME FILES

The following files should come with the game:

	  File			Description
	  ----			-----------
	* turoid.exe 		The game executable
	* tle.exe		Turoid Level Editor
	* turoid.doc		This file
	* score.tur		Holds high score table
	* order.frm		Order (registration) form
	* file_id.diz		BBS description file
	* avemaria.mus		Game score
	* canonind.mus		Game score
	* nightbea.mus		Game score
	* quentin.mus		Game score


- - - - - RUNNING THE GAME

When you have copied all the necessary files into a directory, type
"TUROID" at the prompt to start the game.  When Turoid starts, it first
looks in the default directory for the file "turoid.scr" to load the high
score table.  Make sure that you consistently start Turoid from the
same directory so the high score table can be appropriately updated.

To play Turoid with your custom level set, include the file name
of your levels at the command line.  For example, if the file name for
your levels is called "mylevel.tle", type:

	>TUROID MYLEVEL.TLE

Every level set has its own high score table and the file name that
stores the high score table will be the same as the file name of your level
set, but with different extension.  For example, if the file name for
your levels is called "mylevel.tle" or "mylevel" (with no extension), its
high score table is stored in the file "mylevel.scr". 



- - - - - PLAYING THE GAME

When you start Turoid, the first screen that you see is the
Introduction screen.  This screen shows the title (TUROID) and the
high score table.  Here you can:

	* Click the left mouse button (or hit Return) to start a new game.
	* Click the right mouse button for Help.
	* Press the ESC key to quit Turoid.
	* Press Key 1..9 to set Mouse Sensitivity with 9 being most sensitive.
	  5 is the default value.
        * S to switch sound On/Off
        * B to switch background snow On/Off

Press the left mouse and start a new game.  At the bottom of the
game screen is a status bar.  It shows the number of remaining paddle,
the current level, and your total score.

To start the level, you first position the paddle with the mouse
(note that the paddle move accordingly) by moving the mouse left or
right.  Click
        
        * Left mouse button to shoot the ball to the left.
        * Right mouse button to shoot the ball to the right.

The ball will bounce back against the surrounding walls except the bottom
wall.  You try to prevent the ball from hitting the bottom wall by catching
the ball with the paddle.  If there are no ball left on the screen, the
paddle will die.  You have four paddles for each game.

	If the ball hit a brick, one of the following occurs:

	* If the brick is green, then this brick is immediately destroyed.
	  Green brick is the weakest brick and it only requires one hit
	  to be destroyed.
	* If the brick is orange, two hits are required before it can be
	  destroyed.
	* If the brick is white, three hits are required.
	* Yellow bricks can not be destroyed unless you have special balls
	  (Power or Super ball, I'll explain later).
	* If the brick is purple, the ball inside will fall down.  Try to
	  avoid this falling purple ball.  If your paddle is hit
	  twice with these falling ball, it is destroyed.  The paddle
	  shakes after it's been hit once.
	* If the brick is gold, this is a special brick and many things can
	  occur:
	  	
		* Four surrounding bricks fall down.
 		  Again, try to avoid these falling bricks.
		* The brick becomes 4 balls.
		* The brick becomes 16 balls.
		* The ball turns into a special Power ball (white ball).
		  The Power ball destroys any brick with only one hit.
		* The ball turns into a special Super ball (yellow ball).
		  Super ball is like the Power ball but it does not bounce
		  back.  It only bounces back against the surrounding walls.
		* A circle around the ball.  Move the ball to a new location
		  with the mouse.  Click the left mouse button to release
		  the ball.  The ball is automatically released after five
		  seconds if you don't manually release it.
		* None of the above happens and the gold ball inside fall
		  down (slowly).  This is the ball that you want to catch.
		  Contained in each ball is a hidden special feature.  Try
		  to catch it with the paddle.  The following are possible
		  special features:

		  	* The paddle expands and become wider.  Longer paddle
			  makes ball catching easier.
			* The paddle reduces and become shorter.  Shorter
			  paddle means harder to catch the ball.
			* Paddle's color change to red and makes any ball
			  that you catch stick to the paddle.  This allows
			  you to move the ball to a new location.  Click
			  the left mouse button to release any sticking
			  balls.
			* Paddle changes to a laser paddle.  Click or hold
			  down the left mouse to shoot.  There are two types
			  of laser.  The faster ones are harder to get.
			* Slow down all balls on the screen.  This is
			  helpful sometimes since each ball speed up after
			  a certain period of time.
			* Reduce paddle shaking.  Notice that the special
			  ball also shakes as it falls down.  Try to catch it
			  if you've been hit by a falling brick.
			* Gain one more paddle (very rare).
			* Skip to next level (very rare).

Remember that the only falling object that you want to catch is the
gold ball.

Although there six types of bricks, your task is to only destroy
the green, orange, and white bricks.  You complete the level when all of
these bricks are destroyed.

During the game, the following keys are active:

	* ESC key returns to the Introduction screen.
	* S key to switch sound On/Off.
        * B key to switch background snow On/Off.
	* Space Bar (or p) pauses the game.  Click the left mouse button
	  or any key to continue.
	* Key 1..9 to set Mouse Sensitivity with 9 being most sensitive.

After you finish all levels (or you ran out of paddles), the game
returns to the Introduction screen.

If you qualify for the high score table, you'll be asked to enter
your name in the Introduction screen.  The appropriate line in the high
score table will flash if you qualify.  Enter your name and hit return.


- - - - - BONUS LEVEL

At the end of every level is a bonus level.  If there are some
bricks (yellow, gold, or purple bricks) remaining from the last level,
they will fall down.  Again try to avoid these falling bricks.  After all
the bricks have fallen, the paddle will change into a short laser paddle.

Bonus balls will jump out from either the left or the right walls.
Try to shoot them down and avoid them from hitting you.  Each bonus ball
will bounce five times before it self-destructs.  Each bonus ball
destroyed is worth 20 points.  

At the bottom of the screen shows you the number of bonus balls
you have destroyed so far.
	

- - - - - TECHNICAL INFORMATION

This game was written using Themie Gouthas' public domain
XLIB library (version 04c).  Although the library is fairly complete, I
made some minor changes and added some functions to fit my own need.

The screen mode I used was double-buffered 320x240 mode with
splitscreen at the bottom for the status bar.

I'd like to thank Themie (and his contributors) for his generosity
and released his library to the public.

For music and sound, I used Ezra Dreisbach's FMPLAY module and 
Keven A. Lee's ADLIB module.  Thanks very much guys.
