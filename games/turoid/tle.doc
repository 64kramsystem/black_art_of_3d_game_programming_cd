- - - - - INTRODUCTION

Turoid Level Editor (TLE) let you to create your own levels.
TLE is very intuitive and easy to use.


- - - - - RUNNING TLE

At the DOS prompt, type "TLE" and a file name to start Turoid Level
Editor (TLE).  For example, if your file name is called "mylevel.tle", at
the DOS prompt, type:

	>TLE MYLEVEL.TLE

If the file "mylevel.tle" does not exist, a new file will be created.
(Notice that in the evaluation copy, you don't need to include the file
name since the "Save" feature is not implemented.)  The Introduction screen
appears and you can do the following:

	* Click the left mouse (or hit Return key) to start editing.
	* Click the right mouse button for help.
	* Hit the ESC key to quit.
	* Hit key 1..9 to set mouse sensitivity with 9 being most sensitive.
	  5 is the default value.
        * B to switch background snow On/Off.

In the editing screen, click the left mouse button to draw (or
hold down the left mouse button to draw continuously) or click the right
mouse button to erase.  The default drawing brick is green.

You can change the drawing brick by simply clicking on one of
the six bricks at the bottom of the screen.  The brick at the far
bottom-left corner of the screen, pointed to by an arrow, is the selected
drawing brick.  You can also use short-cut keys to select these drawing
bricks:

	key	selects brick
	---	-------------
	1	green
	2	orange
	3	white
	4	yellow
	5	gold
	6	purple

At the far bottom-right corner of the screen are two numbers.  The
number on the left is the current level being edited.  The number on the
right is the total number of levels.  When you start TLE, there is only
one level in the set.  You can add more levels by simply clicking on a
button.

At the bottom-middle of the screen is a set of buttons that you
can further customize your level sets.  From left to right, here are the
functions of each button:

	Button Description
	------------------						
	* Go to previous level			 	
	* Go to next level
	* Insert a level before the current level
	* Insert a level after the current level
	* Swap two levels
	* Delete the current level
	* Input general information
	* Save levels	(Short Cut: 's' key)
	* Quit 	(Short Cut: ESC key)

There is an online message for each button.  Simply move
the mouse pointer over the button, a message of its function is displayed.

The following is a brief explanation of those buttons that may
not seem obvious.

To swap two levels, click on the "swap" button and a "no-typing-
required" dialog will appear which let you select between two levels to
be swapped.  Select a level in the "First Level" and another in the
"Second Level".  Click the OK button to swap these two levels or click
the Cancel button to close the dialog without swapping.

A "General Information" dialog lets you customize some extra
features of a level.

	* "Number of paddles" is the starting number paddles when you
	  start the game.  If your levels are hard, be sure to give the
	  player enough paddles.
	* "Falling balls."  This determines how often should a purple ball
	  randomly drop down from the top wall.  This also determines how
	  often should a normal brick (green, orange, white and yellow
	  brick) fall down instead of being destroyed when hit by a ball.
	* "Total bonus balls" is the number of bonus balls for the
	  current level.
	* "Maximum number of bonus balls on screen" is maximum number
	  of bonus balls can be on the screen at once.

Click OK button to keep the changes or click the Cancel button the
keep the old values.


- - - - - TECHNICAL INFORMATION

TLE was written using Themie Gouthas' public domain
XLIB library (version 04c).  Although the library is fairly complete, I
made some minor changes and added some functions to fit my own need.

I'd like to thank Themie (and his contributors) for his generosity
and released his library to the public.


- - - - - BUG REPORT

TLE has been tested greatly and there should not be any bug.
But if you "catch" any, please report them to my home address given above
or to my Internet address at "truong@wintermute.fullerton.edu".
