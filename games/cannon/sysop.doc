               Introducing the MVP Distribution Network

Have you heard about the MVP Distribution Network?  MVP Software is joining
forces with BBS sysops in a joint effort that will help both of us.  I'd like
to invite you to become a member of the MVPDN.  Here's how it can benefit you.

Near and dear to all sysops' hearts are callers.  If you run a subscription
BBS, then more callers means more money.  If you run a free BBS, then more
callers means that more people are finding what they want on your system.
Participating in the MVPDN will increase the traffic on your board.

Participating sysops in the MVPDN receive all of our popular games and
entertainment-related shareware directly from MVP Software, before it is
available on other boards or from shareware disk vendors.

What about the quality of our games?  Good question.  AOL chose Sand Storm as
a Top Pick for September 1992.  PsL News chose both Robomaze II and Robomaze
III as the top new arcade games of 1991, tied with several Apogee games.
Corncob 3D, our award-winning flight sim, was nominated in two categories by
the Shareware Industry Awards, received an Editor's Choice in Shareware
Magazine, and has been favorably reviewed in PC/Games, Nuts and Volts, In
Flight, Computer Gaming World, and other publications.  Several of our
games have also been chosen as cover disks by European computer publications.
Retail versions of our games (often identical to the shareware versions) have
sold as many as 50,000 copies in less than a year.

And the best is yet to come.  We now have 20 talented development teams, and
MVP is leading the way in bringing top-notch retail games to the shareware
market.

Don't miss out!  Be the first BBS in your area to carry these hot new
shareware products!  These are just some of the reasons to join the MVPDN now
and grow with us.  It's easy to join the MVP Distribution Network.  Here's
what you do.

1. Not all boards qualify to be a distribution site for MVP Software.  To
   qualify, your board MUST be online 24 hours a day.  I'm sorry, but we
   can't support part-time boards.

2. Call MVP's home BBS, Ryan's Bar, at 616-456-1845 or 616-456-5342.  Download
   all the files in the MVP file section.  These are the files you should post
   on your board in the MVP section.  If you can't get through on Ryan's Bar
   (it can be a busy board), call Exec-PC at 414-789-4360 and download all the
   MVP files from our free file section.  Then call Dave Snyder voice at
   616-245-8376 to register as a distribution site.

3. Create a file section on your system called MVP SOFTWARE.  This file
   section will contain all MVP shareware products.

4. Post the MVP bulletin and the MVP log-on message on your board to let
   your users know you are a distribution site.  These are found in the
   SYSOPMVP.ZIP file.

5. We will notify you of future releases and updates.  You will also
   receive our periodic sysop newsletter, MVPDN News.

And that's all there is to it!  I hope you will join us today.
