    They're ugly. They're stupid. They're weak. They're so unfriendly that
they can't even get along with each other. Unfortunately, there are a lot of
them, and they're all out to get you!

    You managed to get stuck in an anti-aircraft bunker in a strategic area,
without any troop reinforcements. You know that the enemy is going to be
coming in droves, so you're glad that you have a huge supply of ammo to
defend yourself.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
    286 required, 386 STRONGLY recommended.
    VGA graphics card.
    640k, with 535k free from the DOS prompt.
    AdLib, Sound Source, and SoundBlaster optional.
    EMS optional.
    Mouse optional.

THE GAME:
    Your bunker is at the bottom of the screen. You control the position of
the gun with either the keyboard (using the left & right arrow keys to move,
and the spacebar to shoot) or the mouse.

    The enemy aircraft will be coming across the top of the screen, dropping
paratroopers as they go. You need to prevent the paratroopers from landing,
because if three of them land, they'll be able to invade your bunker and
overpower you! (Fortunately for you, they bicker amongst themselves so much
that if they land right next to each other, one of them will kill the other.)

    You can shoot the planes. You can shoot the paratroopers. You can shoot
the paratroopers' chutes off, and watch them plummet helplessly to the
ground (killing any paratroopers that happen to be underneath). Basically,
if it moves, shoot it...

    Be extremely careful with the smart bombs - they're deadly!

SCORING:
    Paratroopers are worth 2 points.
    Big planes are worth 5 points.
    Little planes are worth 10 points.
    Smart bombs are worth 10 points.

    Every time you shoot, you lose a point, so be sure to aim carefully.

INTERMISSIONS:
    After you've beaten back enough of the enemy troops, there'll be a chance
for your compatriots to supply a few things to satisfy basic human needs.
Enjoy the reprieve while you can!

SETUP:
    While the demo loop is running, simply press the "SPACE" key. This will
take you into the control panel.

    When in the control panel, use the up and down arrow keys to move between
the selections, and the "SPACE" or "ENTER" keys to make a selection.

    The first selection is the device to use for sound effects. You can
choose to turn off the sound, use the PC speaker, or, if you have one, use a
Sound Source or SoundBlaster.

    If you're using the Sound Source or SoundBlaster, you can choose how
many digital sound effects can happen at once (one, four, or eight). More
sound effects sound better, but will make the game run slower. If your
machine is slower than a 16MHz 386SX, choose "one." If your machine is faster
than a 16MHz 386SX, I'd recommend "eight."

    If you have an AdLib, SoundBlaster, or compatible, you can turn music
on or off with the next selection.

    The next two items depend on whether or not you're currently in a game.
When you first go into the control panel, the choices are:
    o Start game
    o Back to demo

    Once you've started a game, they change to:
    o Stop game
    o Back to game

    No matter what, there will be another item labeled "Quit to DOS," which
allows you to do just that.

CONCLUSION:
    What are you waiting for? Go to it!
