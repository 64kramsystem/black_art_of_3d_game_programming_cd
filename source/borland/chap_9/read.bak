COMPILATION DETAILS

The source code BLAZER.C might be too large and cause problems with various
versions of the Borland compiler, therefore, I have also added a set of four
files to the Borland version of Starblazer. These four files are basically
the original BLAZER.C source code broken up into a header and three main C
files. The files are:


BLAZER.C =


   BLAZEM0.C - The main module that contains the globals and the main().
   BLAZEM1.C - A support module with various low level functions for the game.
   BLAZEM2.C - A support module with all of the game related functions.
   BLAZEM0.H - The header portion needed for the above files.

Also, when compiling, I suggest that you set the ide and linker so that the
code has NO debug information in it. This will not only make the .EXE
smaller, but it will execute faster.
